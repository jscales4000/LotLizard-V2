# LotLizard V2 Equipment Library Feature Roadmap

## Feature Overview

The equipment library is a core component of LotLizard V2 that allows users to place, manage, and customize various equipment items on the event layout canvas. The library serves as a centralized repository of equipment templates that can be dragged onto the canvas, positioned precisely, rotated as needed, and labeled appropriately to create accurate event layouts.

### Current Equipment Library Functionality:
- Basic equipment templates with predefined dimensions
- Drag and drop placement onto the canvas
- Manual positioning with coordinate control
- Basic equipment labels that can now be toggled on/off
- Hover popup feature that shows equipment name after 1-second hover when labels are hidden
- Equipment selection and basic manipulation
- Ctrl + mouse scroll wheel rotation for selected equipment
- Persistence of equipment items in saved projects

## Planned Enhancements

### 1. Equipment Library Organization and UI
- **Searchable Equipment Catalog**: Implement a search function to quickly find specific equipment types
- **Equipment Categories**: Organize equipment into logical categories (e.g., stages, tents, seating, amenities, barriers)
- **Visual Thumbnails**: Add visual previews of each equipment type for easier recognition
- **Favorites System**: Allow users to mark commonly used equipment as favorites for quick access
- **Recently Used Items**: Track and display recently used equipment items
- **Equipment Details Panel**: Show detailed specifications when an item is selected in the library

### 2. Equipment Customization
- **Custom Equipment Creation**: Allow users to create and save custom equipment items
- **Equipment Templates**: Save configured equipment as reusable templates
- **Equipment Groups**: Create and save groups of related equipment items
- **Color Coding**: Apply color schemes to equipment for better visual organization
- **Custom Properties**: Add user-defined properties to equipment (e.g., weight, power requirements)
- **Equipment Notes**: Attach notes to specific equipment items

### 3. Equipment Interaction and Manipulation
- **Multi-select Capabilities**: Select multiple equipment items at once
- 
- **Alignment Tools**: Snap equipment to grid or to other equipment items
- **Z-order Control**: Manage which equipment appears in front/behind others
- **Lock Position**: Prevent accidental movement of finalized equipment
- **Equipment Duplication**: Quickly create copies with same properties

### 4. Equipment Data and Analytics
- **Equipment Inventory**: Track available vs. placed equipment
- **Area Utilization**: Calculate space usage and density
- **Equipment Reports**: Generate lists of equipment used in the layout
- **Export Equipment Lists**: Create detailed equipment manifests for procurement
- **Equipment Requirements**: Calculate power, staffing, or other resource needs

### 5. Advanced Features
- **Equipment Rules**: Define spacing rules or requirements between equipment types
- **Conflict Detection**: Highlight when equipment is placed improperly
- **3D Visualization**: Add simple 3D views of equipment layout
- **Time-based Placement**: Schedule equipment for different phases of event setup
- **Version Control**: Track changes to equipment placement over time
- **Real-world Scale Integration**: Ensure equipment sizes are accurate to real-world dimensions

## Immediate Implementation Tasks

1. **Equipment Search and Filtering**:
   - Add search input to equipment library drawer
   - Implement filtering logic based on equipment name and properties
   - Show/hide equipment based on search results

2. **Equipment Categorization**:
   - Define logical categories for equipment types
   - Update equipment data structure to include category information
   - Add category filtering UI to equipment library drawer
   - Implement collapsible category sections

3. **Custom Equipment Creation**:
   - Design UI for custom equipment definition
   - Add form for dimensions, name, and properties
   - Implement save functionality for custom equipment
   - Allow editing of custom equipment

4. **Equipment Visualization Improvements**:
   - Add thumbnail previews to equipment library items
   - Improve visual representation on the canvas
   - Add optional detailed view with specifications
   - Implement consistent visual language for equipment types

5. **Equipment Grouping and Multi-select**:
   - Implement multi-selection UI and logic
   - Add group creation, saving, and manipulation
   - Ensure groups maintain relative positions when moved
   - Allow groups to be saved as templates

## Technical Implementation Considerations

- Update the equipment data model to support new metadata (categories, custom properties)
- Extend the mapStore to handle equipment grouping and advanced selection
- Create new UI components for enhanced equipment library experience
- Implement efficient search algorithms for large equipment libraries
- Design a robust custom equipment serialization format
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing project files

## Success Metrics

- Reduced time to find and place equipment items
- Increased variety of equipment items used in layouts
- Higher accuracy in equipment placement and scale
- Improved user satisfaction with equipment management workflow
- Reduced errors in equipment positioning and conflicts
