# Project Log - LotLizard V2

## Version 0.1.0 (August 8, 2025)

### Drawer Architecture and Animation Fixes

#### Changes:
- **Fixed Drawer Architecture**: Moved drawer components (Projects, ImageImport, Settings) out of LeftSidebar and into AppLayout as siblings to the sidebar, ensuring proper z-index layering
- **Synchronized Tab Animations**: Created custom styled components in ImageImportDrawer that synchronize tab indicator animations with drawer transitions
- **Improved State Management**: Centralized drawer state in AppLayout with interlocked behavior (only one drawer can be open at a time)
- **Optimized Z-Index Values**: Adjusted z-index values to ensure drawers appear behind the sidebar (not over it)

#### Technical Details:
- Refactored component architecture to ensure proper DOM hierarchy
- Implemented custom styled components using Material-UI's styled API
- Disabled default Material-UI tab indicator transitions with `transition: none !important`
- Added conditional display of tab indicator based on drawer open state
- Fixed prop passing between AppLayout and LeftSidebar components

#### Benefits:
- Drawers correctly slide out from behind the sidebar
- Tab indicator moves in sync with drawer transitions without lag
- Smoother and more professional transition animations
- Improved code maintainability with centralized drawer state
